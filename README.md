In order to run my website: Double-click "website.html"

The input validation performed in my website is in terms of the "Contact me" form in the end of the page. There, I validate that the 4 text boxes are filled and specifically filled according to their descriptions. Only once the answers suffice, I allow the client to submit the form successfully through the mailto extension.
