Inorder to run my website: double-click "website.html"

The input validation performed in my website is in terms of the "Contact me" form in the end of the page. There I validate that the 4 text boxes are filled but also filled according to their discriptions. Only when the answers suffice I let the client submit the form successfully through the mailto extension.
